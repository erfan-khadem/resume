Dear Sir or Madam,

As an undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering at Sharif
University of Technology, a curious learner with a great predisposition
toward wireless communication and data security, I am writing to express
my interest in the summer internship position at EPFL.

Throughout my studies in electrical engineering, I have primarily
focused in the areas of wireless sensing and security applications with
occasional forays into electronics and circuit design. I have led
several projects using signal processing and data analysis techniques,
such as a recent research project that employed Principal Component
Analysis coupled with the Lomb-Scargle method to analyze WiFi Channel
State Information taken from commodity hardware for the purpose of
breathing analysis. Additionally, in the context of cybersecurity, I
developed a versatile utility for censorship circumvention which is
currently in widespread use in Iran. These experiences enhanced my core
engineering skills: the ability to troubleshoot, adapt to challenges,
and analyze real-world applications.

During my academic journey, I have been deeply inspired by the
groundbreaking contributions of the many great minds that have enabled
the likes of Moore and Dennard’s scaling trends. This has inspired me to
seek the privilege of working under the supervision of the likes of
professor Andreas Burg and Babak Falsafi. Professor Burg’s work on low
power VLSI signal processing and hardware implementation of
communication algorithms resonates strongly with my experience in
WiFi-CSI analysis and my passion for wireless sensing technologies.
Additionally, Professor Falsafi’s pioneering research on scalable
computing aligns with my interest in exploring new architectures and
hardware-software interaction for modern computational challenges. The
excellent work of these gentlemen motivates me to deepen my expertise in
both wireless systems and computational architecture and exemplify the
kind of impactful research I want to have in my future career.

In my final words, I want to emphasize that beyond my technical
expertise, I am a proactive problem solver, and a fast learner with a
computer science background. Most important of all, my ongoing role as
the head TA of the computer architecture laboratory has underpinned my
passion for team work in the context of academia; therefore, I consider
my professional and educational experience to be in good concordance
with the ethos of this internship program. I am excited about the
possibility of contributing to and learning from experts at EPFL and I
am confident that this opportunity will be an important stride in my
professional and personal growth.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Erfan Khadem
